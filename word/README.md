# Word JavaScript APIs

Welcome to the Word JavaScript API documentation. You are currently reading documentation in our old location. We have moved the new Word JavaScript API reference documentation under [reference/word](../reference/word). That is where the JavaScript API is for the Word specific APIs. Go to the [shared reference](../shared) for the JavaScript APIs that were introduced with Word 2013. Our conceptual documentation for thenew Word API are now located under [docs/word](../docs/word)

We are moving our content from MSDN to [dev.office.com](http://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins?product=word). Use the filter to see topics that are applicable to Word.

We now provide information about new Word APIs in the [WordJs_1.3_Openspec](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/tree/WordJs_1.3_Openspec/word) branch. Learn what new APIs are coming out for Word, provide feedback on the APIs, and open issues against the proposed features and documentation.

## Try it out

We've been working on a Snippet Explorer to let you browse through common code snippets and learn how the new APIs work. Give it a try. The code snippets referenced by the Snippet Explorer are available [here](https://officesnippetexplorer.azurewebsites.net/#/snippets/word).

## Give feedback

We need it, you want to give it. Feedback is much easier to give now that we're on GitHub. Check out the docs and let us know about any [issues](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/issues) you find in those docs by submitting issues directly in this repository. Let us know what you think about the APIs and the general programming experience.

We suggest you use the tags [office-js] and [word] on StackOverflow for asking questions to the community.
