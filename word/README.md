# Word JavaScript APIs

Welcome to the Word JavaScript API documentation repo. W Here you can find everything you need to create the next generation of Word add-ins in Office 2016 for Windows. The new APIs provide a variety of Word-specific functionality related to documents, paragraphs, content controls, and other common Word objects. This API complements the functionality of our existing Office.js library. 

This documentation is published on MSDN at <!-- NEED THE LINK WHEN AVAILABLE -->

## Try it out

We've working on a Snippet Explorer to let you browse through common code snippets and learn how the new APIs work. Give it a try. The code snippets referenced by the Snippet Explorer are available [here](http://officesnippetexplorer.azurewebsites.net/#/snippets/word).
