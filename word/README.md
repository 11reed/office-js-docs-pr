# Word JavaScript APIs

Welcome to the Word JavaScript API documentation repo. Here you'll find what you'll need to create the next generation of Word add-ins in Office 2016 for Windows (if you can't find it, open an issue). The new Word Javascript APIs provide Word-specific functionality related to documents, paragraphs, content controls, and other common Word objects. This API complements the functionality of our existing Office.js library. 

This documentation is [published on MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj220060.aspx).

## Try it out

We've working on a Snippet Explorer to let you browse through common code snippets and learn how the new APIs work. Give it a try. The code snippets referenced by the Snippet Explorer are available [here](https://officesnippetexplorer.azurewebsites.net/#/snippets/word). 

## Give feedback

We need it, you want to give it. Feedback is much easier now that we are on GitHub. Check out the docs and let us know about any [issues](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/issues) you find in those docs by submitting issues directly in this repo. Let us know what you think about the APIs and the general programming experience.
