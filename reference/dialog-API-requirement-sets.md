# Dialog API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office host supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Specify Office hosts and API requirements](../docs/overview/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md).

Office Add-ins run across multiple versions of Office including Office for Windows Desktop, Office Online, Office for the Mac, and Office for the iPad. The following table lists the Dialog API requirement sets, the Office host applications that support that requirement set, and the build versions.

|  Requirement set  |  Office Online  |  Office 2016 for Windows  |  Office 2016 for iPad  |  Office 2016 for Mac  |
|:-----|-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Dialog API 1.1  | Currently not supported| 16.0.6741.0000 | 1.22 or later | 15.20 or later|

> **Note**: For build numbers associated with Office Online Server and Office 365 Deferred Channel build, see [Other Office hosts and API requirements](other-Office-hosts-and-requirement-sets.md).
