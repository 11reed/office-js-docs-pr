# Set up your development environment

This guide will help you set up tools so you can create Office Add-ins following our quick start guides or tutorials. You'll need to install tools in the list below, which you may already have. If you already have these installed, you should be ready to begin a quick start, such as this [Excel quick start]().

- Node.js
- npm
- An Office 365 (the subscription version of Office) account
- A code editor of your choice
- A command line tool if necessary

## Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime you will need in order to develop modern Office Add-ins. 

To install Node.js, visit their [website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Install npm

Npm is an open source software registry, which allows you to download the packages which you will need to develop Office Add-ins.

To install npm, run the following in the command line:

```command&nbsp;line
    npm install npm -g
```

To check if you already have npm installed and see the installed version, run the following in the command line:

```command&nbsp;line
npm -v
```

You may wish to use a Node version manager to allow you to switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm, but this is not strictly necessary. For details on how to do this, [see npm's instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

## Get Office 365

If you don't already have an Office 365 account, you can get a free, 90-day renewable Office 365 subscription by joining the [Office 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program).

## Install a code editor

## Install a command line tool
