# Publish your Office Add-in


You can publish your add-ins to the Office Store or upload them to a private shared folder add-in catalog on SharePoint, or an Exchange server. The options that are available depend on the type of add-in you create. 

For information about publishing to the Office Store, see [Submit add-ins and web apps to the Office Store](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff075782-1303-4517-91cc-b3d730e9b9ae%28Office.15%29.aspx). 

Administrators can also deploy custom add-ins to users in an organization via the Office 365 admin center. For information, see [Deploy Office Add-ins in the Office 365 admin center preview](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Deploy-Office-Add-Ins-in-Office-365-737e8c86-be63-44d7-bf02-492fa7cd9c3f?ui=en-US&rs=en-IE&ad=IE).

To broaden the reach of your add-in, make sure that it works across platforms. The Office.js version 1.1 includes support for Office Online, and the Office Store validation process verifies add-in support for Office Online. Before you publish, [test your add-in](../testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing.md) to make sure that it works in Office Online.

For information about how end users acquire, insert, and run add-ins, see [Start using your Office Add-in](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Start-using-your-Office-Add-in-82e665c4-6700-4b56-a3f3-ef5441996862?ui=en-US&rs=en-IE&ad=IE).
