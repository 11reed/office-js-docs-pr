To broaden the reach of your add-in, make sure that it works across platforms. The Office.js version 1.1 includes support for Office Online, and the Office Store validation process verifies add-in support for Office Online. Before you publish, [test your add-in](../testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing.md) to make sure that it works in Office Online.

For information about how end users acquire, insert, and run add-ins, see [Start using your Office Add-in](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Start-using-your-Office-Add-in-82e665c4-6700-4b56-a3f3-ef5441996862?ui=en-US&rs=en-IE&ad=IE).
