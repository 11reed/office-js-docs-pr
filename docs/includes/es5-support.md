For some versions of Office and Windows, the JavaScript engine in which add-ins run is provided by Internet Explorer. (For details of which versions, see [Browsers used by Office Add-ins](../concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins.md).) The Internet Explorer engine does not support versions of JavaScript later than ES5. This means that without special handling, the JavaScript files that your add-in serves cannot use syntax, types, or methods that were added to the language after ES5. This does not mean that you must *write* in ES5 syntax. You have two other options:

- Write your code in ECMAScript 2015 (also called ES6) or later JavaScript, or in TypeScript, and then compile your code to ES5 JavaScript using a compiler such as [babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html).
- Write in ECMAScript 2015 or later JavaScript, but also load a [polyfill](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)) library such as [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) that enables IE to run your code.
