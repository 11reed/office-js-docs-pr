##Functions with InfoBar notifications

In addition to using a task pane or custom pane to display custom HTML UI in your Outlook add-in, you can execute functions from commands. When you need to display UI text as a result of a function, you can use InfoBar notifications. For example, you might need to use an InfoBar notification to display error or success messages.
