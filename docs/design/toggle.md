# Toggle component in Office UI Fabric

Toggles represent a physical switch to turn things on or off. Use Toggles to present two mutually exclusive options (for example, on and off), where choosing an option results in an immediate action.
  
#### Example: Toggle in a task pane

## Best Practices

|**Do**|**Don't**|
|:------------|:--------------|
|Use a Toggle for binary settings when changes become effective immediately after the user changes them (see image below).|Donâ€™t use a Toggle if it requires users to perform an extra step for changes to take effect (see image below).|
|![Do Toggle example](../../images/toggleDo.png)|![Don't Toggle example](../../images/toggleDont.png)|
|Only replace the On and Off labels if there are more specific labels to use for a setting. Use short (3-4 character) labels that represent binary opposites.| |

## Variants

|**Variation**|**Description**|**Example**|
