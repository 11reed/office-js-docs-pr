# Word add-ins

Welcome to the Excel add-in JavaScript API documentation. The Excel JavaScript API is a part of the Office add-in programming model for extending Microsoft Office applications. The add-in programming model uses web applications to host your extension to Excel. You can now extend Excel with any web platform or language that you prefer. 

## Get started now

Are you the type that wants to read fewer words and just wants to see the code? Then let's go and [build your first Excel add-in](build-your-first-excel-add-in.md). 

## API Overview

Before we start, you need to know that this new Excel add-in model is different than what was available with Excel in Office 2013. The previous object model was not typed and provided a generic API for extending Office clients. While this model is still applicable to Excel 2016, we strongly suggest that you start using the new E object model. This new object model provides access to familiar Excel objects like: Workbook, Worksheet, Range, Table, and Chart.

## Give feedback on the API

The documentation for this API is hosted on GitHub with the intention that we can improve the documentation by making it open for opening [issues](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/issues) against the documentation. Issues can include errors in the documentation, requests for clarification, or requests for improvements in the documentation. We also welcome general feedback about the API and the experience you have with it.
